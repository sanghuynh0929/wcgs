# Analysis on Western Collaborative Study Group 

Our project focuses on the tasks of Data Analysis, Statistical Model (Logistic Regression)
and Survival Analysis. Through those tasks, we are able to draw some conclusions and test our
prior assumptions about the data.


The Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS) dataset is a valuable resource in
epidemiology for understanding the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease
(CHD). This longitudinal study, conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, followed a cohort of
initially healthy men aged 39-59 years, collecting extensive data on medical history, phys-
ical examinations, laboratory tests, and lifestyle factors. Through the analysis of this
dataset, our project aims to investigate the relationships between smoking, cholesterol
levels, blood pressure, obesity, and the development of CHD. By exploring these associa-
tions, we hope to contribute to the existing knowledge base on cardiovascular health and
provide insights for future prevention and intervention strategies.
